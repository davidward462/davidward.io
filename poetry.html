<h2 class="title">The House on the Hill</h2>

<p>
Along the path
<br>to find at last
<br>the house that all have shunned.
<br>Through the gate
<br>no longer wait
<br>to walk without the sun.
<br>Into its depths
<br>you walk bereft
<br>of any shame or fear.
<br>For in your heart
<br>all 'round is dark,
<br>but in your mind is clear.
</p>

<br>
<h2 class="title">The Enemy</h2>
<p>
From his homeland he marched; 
<br>Proud son, fearless warrior.
<br>For his nation he fought;
<br>Through the mud and rubble he trod,
<br>spilling blood, taking lives. 
<br>A righteous mission for the greater good.
<br>In his own heart he marched for the love of his nation.
<br>But in my eyes he marched for hate.
<br>So I killed him. And as my gunshots rang out
<br>and he fell before me,
<br>with a dark pool swelling beneath him, I was proud.
<br>I was the hero! 
<br>Defender of Peace, Soldier of Justice,
<br>proud son, fearless warrior. 
<br>Because those like him, the soldiers of hate,
<br>they must die!  
<br>Mustnâ€™t they?
<br>For it is, of course, my righteous mission.
