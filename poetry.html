<h2 class="title">The House on the Hill</h2>

<p>
Along the path
<br>to find at last
<br>the house that all have shunned.
<br>Through the gate
<br>no longer wait
<br>to walk without the sun.
<br>Into its depths
<br>you walk bereft
<br>of any shame or fear.
<br>For in your heart
<br>all 'round is dark,
<br>but in your mind is clear.
</p>

<br>
<h2 class="title">The Enemy</h2>
<p>
From his homeland he marched; 
<br>Proud son, fearless warrior.
<br>For his nation he fought;
<br>Through the mud and rubble he trod,
<br>spilling blood, taking lives. 
<br>A righteous mission for the greater good.
<br>In his own heart he marched for the love of his nation.
<br>But in my eyes he marched for hate.
<br>So I killed him. And as my gunshots rang out
<br>and he fell before me,
<br>with a dark pool swelling beneath him, I was proud.
<br>I was the hero! 
<br>Defender of Peace, Soldier of Justice,
<br>proud son, fearless warrior. 
<br>Because those like him, the soldiers of hate,
<br>they must die!  
<br>Mustn’t they?
<br>For it is, of course, my righteous mission. 
</p>

<br>
<h2 class="title">The Pilgrim</h2>
<p>
Clad in cloak and bearing mighty blade,
<br>The Pilgrim treads the wild woods. 
<br>The churning clouds above
<br>bring a tempest against an emerald sea,
<br>And below, the shadows come alive. 
<br>From the branches, water drips
<br>Into pools where dark things crawl.
<br>His glass eye spies twisted metal among the roots,
<br>Flat rock, up-heaved by Nature and Time. 
<br>The thistles, with thorns like devil’s claws
<br>Break upon his iron skin,
<br>but he is unperturbed.
<br>
<br>Now hill he meets, and he ascends,
<br>His iron grip marring rock, crushing twig and branch. 
<br>His cloak is tattered, and as the summit is reached 
<br>It is torn from him by the storm.
<br>But the wind parts the clouds of heaven, 
<br>Flooding the earth with golden honey light. 
<br>The Pilgrim stands; his bones gleaming in the sun. 
<br>Ahead in view, is single goal,
<br>The City of Glass. 
<br>He descends the ragged land.
<br>
<br>As The Pilgrim walks between the towers
<br>They seem to stretch upwards to infinity. 
<br>At the base of the tallest spire lies The Shrine. 
<br>Before it, he kneels, 
<br>And speaks the holy words. 
<br>As he mutters, from the shrine stares 
<br>an out-of-place oddity,
<br>organic, rough, weather-worn.
<br>A skull, like his, 
<br>but made of bone, like the creatures of the plains.
<br>For it is the shine to the Creator.
The shrine to his GOD called MAN.  
</p>

<h2 class="title">Untitled</h2>
<p>
A fetter, in the lighted way, 
<br>unfurled of blackened course.
<br>Seen in torchlight, dim and red, 
<br>amid the grand remorse.
</p>

<br>
<h2 class="title">Untitled</h2>
<p>
Amid the fields of dancing green,
<br>the stillness lays thus seen by he
<br>who, to the grass, touches tenderly.
