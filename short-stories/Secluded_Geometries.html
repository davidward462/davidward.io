<h1>Secluded Geometries</h1>

<div class="prose">

I walked through the doorway, shielding my eyes from the glaring sunlight that now shone down at me. My eyes were not accustomed to this, after wandering for some unknown time through those dimly-lit hallways and endless rooms. Even those windows which I had seen there only showed other rooms through them, or patches of strange darkness. After a few moments my eyes adjusted, and I saw that I had found a different place.

Through the door was a large grass field, like a sports pitch. The grass was cut short and was coloured a deeper and richer emerald than I had ever seen. The field was roughly rectangular, several hundred feet wide, and half that in length. Along the perimeter was a high wooden fence, the top of which I only would have been able to reach had I raised my arms fully above my head. The wood was pale and weathered, like it had been subjected to sunlight, wind, and rain for a considerable period of time. In it I could see no gaps or holes. Behind the fence was a monolithic wall of pine and cedar trees, no less than sixty feet tall. They encircled the entire perimeter of the field, invoking a strange kind of seclusion and separation, like the way in indoor plant is separated from the rest of nature outside, but still is of the same substance.

Strangest of all was the sky. It was a bright, vibrant blue, and utterly clear. As I studied it, an unease grew inside me, as I could not see the sun anywhere. I cast my eyes to the fence and trees again, and saw that they did not cast any shadows at all. At this point I stepped out of the doorway and onto the grass, desiring to find the sun but also to get a look at the exterior of the building I just came from.

I walked out further, the light from the sky warming me significantly, and I realized how cold I had been. Upon turning around to face the door, I backed up further, very confused. It seemed like I had been walking for hours, perhaps longer, often going up and down flights of stairs, and encountering very tall and wide rooms. But now, seeing the building from the outside, that seemed impossible. It was entirely windowless, made of red brick, and was not more than twelve feet high. The structure was wide, and extended further than I could see. The fence around the field was attached directly to exterior wall, and it was because of this geometry that I realized the wall curved slightly inward as it went into the distance, as if the building was rounded, or at least not built entirely of right angles.

The door of the building remained partly closed, as I had left it, and was the only detail that broke the monotonous pattern of brick. Now at the centre of the grass, I had a full view of the sky. Nowhere, either at the treeline or the zenith, could the sun be seen. The light seemed to emanate from the sky itself, and looking down I saw that my shadow was barely visible, as if I was illuminated from many different angles.

I was at a loss of what to do. While making my way through that maze-like building, when I had come to a dead end I simply turned around and found a route which I had not travelled before. But this field had no other exit, I was sure. As I stood there, I felt a stillness and strange peace which I had been lacking inside that building. It had seemed like I had been walking through those halls for hours, perhaps days, and near the end I had felt my mind slipping. How had I become lost in there? Recalling, it seemed impossible that any man-made structure was so large and elaborate, and I could find no explanation.

The tension and fear which had been growing as I had wandered was now resolved. The light was welcoming in a strange way, and though there were no birds or other sounds, I was calm. Lucid. This place had about itself an odd feeling of finality, as if I would never need anything more, and never did.

The thought crept into my mind of what waited behind the fence and behind those trees, but somehow I knew there was not anything. I knew that if I did manage to peer over the fence, there would certainly, and without a doubt, be nothing. The sky, in its brilliant blue beyond any blue, gave an indescribably geometric appearance, as if it was the interior of a sphere. A sphere, the inside of which was both very near above me, and of an infinite distance away. It was as though nothing held me, and nothing supported the ground I was standing on, and nothing needed to.

My unease at the lack of sun was gone, and I knew I was not in danger here. I lay down on the grass, looking upwards. From this position I couldnâ€™t see the fence of the tops of the trees, the field was too wide. Now the entirety of my vision was consumed by the clear and absolutely bright blue above me. It was as if the sky had fallen towards me, and was now mere feet away. The ground fell away too, and I drifted into the infinite.
