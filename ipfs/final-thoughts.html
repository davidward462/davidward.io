        <h2>The Real Purpose of IPFS</h2>

        <p>
        Based on some feedback, I will say a few words at a high level about the purpose and value of IPFS. The 
        main benefit of the system is directly about how it functions, and not so much about some feature that is 
        provides. Yes, IPFS has forms of file-version, and some other interesting things, but the main purpose 
        is that it is decentralized. It is a system that is more robust than most other server-based approaches 
        because it does not rely on someone to provide hosting. 
        </p>

        <h2>Report Reflections</h2>
        <p>
        Overall, the report writing went fairly well. The main issue I encountered early on is how difficult it 
        is to do good-quality research on IPFS because it is not centralized, and the research papers I read 
        agreed on this. I was thankful that others had undertaken this work, but that did not leave me with as 
        much to do on my own as I expected. While in theory it would have been possible to do some data collection 
        on IPFS, it would have taken quite a lot of coding and would probably just replicated what others had 
        found, at a smaller scale and less reliability. 

        Something I did not cover that certainly warrants investigation is IPFS gateways. This is the way that 
        the IPFS network can directly interface with HTTP on the standard web. This is how someone can access a 
        file hosted on IPFS through a regular browser, because otherwise this would not be possible. Herein lies 
        the main issue in connecting IPFS with the rest of the Internet. I do not know what the solution is how 
        how this should be addressed in the future, but it is an appropriate topic for further research and 
        experimentation.
